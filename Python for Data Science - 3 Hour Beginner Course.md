## Key Concepts Covered

### Essential for Advanced Notebooks:
- ‚úÖ **List slicing** (`X[0:3]`) - Used extensively in ML notebooks
- ‚úÖ **NumPy arrays** and operations (`.dot()`, `.T`, broadcasting)
- ‚úÖ **Matplotlib plotting** (`plt.plot()`, `plt.xlabel()`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Import statements** (`import numpy as np`, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
- ‚úÖ **For loops** and iteration over data
- ‚úÖ **String formatting** (% operator, f-strings)
- ‚úÖ **Basic mathematical operations** and statistical concepts
- ‚úÖ **Function calls** and method usage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed
- Python 3.7+ with the following packages:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

### Installation
If you don't have the required packages, install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Course
1. Download all notebook files to a single directory
2. Open Jupyter Notebook in that directory: `jupyter notebook`
3. Start with `01_python_basics.ipynb` and work through in order
4. Execute each cell by pressing Shift+Enter
5. Complete the practice exercises in each notebook

## Course Files

1. `01_python_basics.ipynb` - Variables, data types, basic operations
2. `02_control_structures.ipynb` - Conditional statements, loops, error handling
3. `03_lists_data_structures.ipynb` - Lists, indexing, slicing, tuples
4. `04_dictionaries_advanced.ipynb` - Dictionaries, nested data structures
5. `05_pandas_preview.ipynb` - Quick introduction to pandas basics
6. `06_functions_modules.ipynb` - Functions, parameters, modules, imports
7. `07_numpy_fundamentals.ipynb` - NumPy arrays, operations, linear algebra
8. `08_matplotlib_basics.ipynb` - Plotting, visualization, customization
9. `09_capstone_project.ipynb` - Comprehensive weather data analysis project

## Teaching Notes

### For Instructors:
- Each notebook includes detailed explanations and examples
- Practice exercises are provided throughout
- Notebooks build progressively - don't skip ahead
- Encourage students to experiment with the code
- Allow extra time for students who need it

### Pacing Guidelines:
- **Beginners:** May need 4-5 hours total
- **Some programming experience:** 3 hours as designed
- **Quick learners:** May finish in 2.5 hours

### Common Issues:
- **Import errors:** Ensure numpy and matplotlib are installed
- **Jupyter issues:** Make sure Jupyter is properly installed and running
- **Syntax errors:** Emphasize proper indentation in Python

## Assessment and Practice

Each notebook includes:
- **Hands-on exercises** with real data science scenarios
- **Progressive difficulty** building on previous concepts
- **Real examples** that mirror advanced ML notebooks
- **Practice problems** for reinforcement

## Next Steps After Completion

Students will be ready to:
1. **Understand advanced notebooks** with machine learning algorithms
2. **Work with pandas** for data manipulation
3. **Use scikit-learn** for machine learning
4. **Explore real datasets** and perform analysis
5. **Build their own** data science projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Jupyter won't start:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

**Import errors:**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

**Plots not showing:**
- Make sure `%matplotlib inline` is executed
- Try restarting the Jupyter kernel

**Code not working:**
- Check for proper indentation
- Ensure all cells are executed in order
- Restart kernel and run all cells if needed
