## 🎯 Course Mission

**The Problem**: Most data science courses assume you already know programming. They throw you into pandas DataFrames and machine learning algorithms without teaching the foundational Python skills you actually need.

**Our Solution**: A laser-focused course that teaches Python specifically for data science success. Every concept, exercise, and project directly prepares you for real data science work.

**The Result**: Students who can read, understand, and write professional data science code from day one.

print(x[0])  # Prints: 1
```

**Our Approach:**
```python
# Analyze student test scores to find top performer
test_scores = [78, 92, 85, 96, 88]
top_score = test_scores[3]  # Extract the highest score
print(f"Best performance: {top_score}%")
```
