## What Sets Our Graduates Apart

### **They Can Read Advanced Notebooks**
Our students don't just copy-paste code. They understand what `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)` actually means because they've mastered the underlying concepts.

### **They Think Like Data Scientists**
Through carefully crafted exercises, students develop the problem-solving mindset that separates successful data scientists from code copiers.

### **They Have a Solid Foundation**
When they encounter scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or advanced statistics, they're not struggling with basic Python syntax‚Äîthey can focus on the new concepts.
