### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- pip package manager

#### Installation
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Jupyter kernel:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=data-science-course --display-name="Python (Data Science Course)"
```

### Running the Course
1. Activate your virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. In Jupyter, make sure to select the "Python (Data Science Course)" kernel
4. Start with `01_python_basics.ipynb` and work through in order
5. Execute each cell by pressing Shift+Enter
6. Complete the practice exercises in each notebook

### Deactivating the Environment
When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment:

## Teaching Notes

### For Instructors:
- Each notebook includes detailed explanations and examples
- Practice exercises are provided throughout
- Notebooks build progressively - don't skip ahead
- Encourage students to experiment with the code
- Allow extra time for students who need it

### Pacing Guidelines:
- **Beginners:** May need 4-5 hours total
- **Some programming experience:** 3 hours as designed
- **Quick learners:** May finish in 2.5 hours

### Common Issues:
- **Import errors:** Ensure numpy and matplotlib are installed
- **Jupyter issues:** Make sure Jupyter is properly installed and running
- **Syntax errors:** Emphasize proper indentation in Python

## Next Steps After Completion

Students will be ready to:
1. **Understand advanced notebooks** with machine learning algorithms
2. **Work with pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
3. **Use scikit-learn** for machine learning without syntax confusion
4. **Explore real datasets** and perform meaningful analysis
5. **Build their own** data science projects with confidence
6. **Read and contribute to** open-source data science projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Jupyter won't start:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

**Import errors:**
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
# Or reinstall all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Plots not showing:**
- Make sure `%matplotlib inline` is executed
- Try restarting the Jupyter kernel
- Check if matplotlib is properly installed: `import matplotlib`

**Code not working:**
- Check for proper indentation (Python is whitespace-sensitive)
- Ensure all cells are executed in order
- Restart kernel and run all cells if needed
- Clear output and restart: Kernel ‚Üí Restart & Clear Output

**Virtual environment issues:**
```bash
# Recreate virtual environment
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Permission errors (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Slow performance:**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Restart Jupyter notebook
- Check available RAM: Activity Monitor (Mac) or Task Manager (Windows)
- Consider upgrading hardware if below minimum requirements
